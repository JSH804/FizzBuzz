# FizzBuzz
My solution to the FizzBuzz problem

The FizzBuzz problem is: 
If given the number 100, print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. For all other numbers simply print.

Using C#.

I saw some solutions to the FizzBuzz problem and figured it would be better to create a static class with a method that can accept any integer, not just 100. This way the code is reusable. Method's name is FbDoMath() within the class file FbLogic.

Also, created a simple .NET Console App to test the method. Code within the Program file.
